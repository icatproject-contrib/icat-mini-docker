icat-mini-docker - A minimal ICAT deployment with Docker
========================================================

This repository aims to provide a runtime environment to deploy an
`ICAT`_ service using Docker containers.  The aim is to keep that as
simple as possible, yet still to provide a complete running
deployment.  The main goal is to demonstrate how the ICAT Docker
container are supposed to be used.  At the same time it may be used as
a starting point to build a real production environment.
